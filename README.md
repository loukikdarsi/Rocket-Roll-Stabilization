# Rocket-Roll-Stabilization

This project focuses on stabilizing the roll of a model rocket using sensors such as the BMP280 (barometric pressure sensor) and MPU9250 (9-axis motion tracking device). The BMP280 is utilized to measure altitude, helping to monitor the rocket's ascent and descent. The MPU9250 provides real-time data on the rocket's orientation.

The stabilization system processes the sensor data to detect any unwanted roll during flight and automatically adjusts the rocket's fins to counteract this roll. This ensures a stable flight path, improving the accuracy and safety of the rocket's trajectory. The system is designed to be lightweight and responsive, making it suitable for small-scale model rockets.
